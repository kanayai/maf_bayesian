* Everytime there is a change in the code AND the user asks for some explanation afterwards then add the explanation into a new document in the docs folder. Use  .qmd format with appropriate  YAML header and also add file name to _quarto.yml file.

* Everytime there is a successful new feature added into project then add a brief description into the project README file. This does not apply to features in branches (other than the master) except when the branch is merged with the master.

* when adding bullet list in a .qmd file, make sure there is a linebreak just before the first bullet point so the list displays correctly in the further generated output
