# Preface {.unnumbered}

This report documents the Bayesian analysis pipeline for the MAF project, including model definitions, statistical methodology, and validation results.

## Overview {.unnumbered}
The project uses Gaussian Process (GP) emulators to calibrate material parameters from experimental load-extension data. This document compiles the technical documentation for the codebase and the statistical methods employed.

## Recent Updates
-   **Residual Analysis**: A comprehensive diagnostic suite has been added to `analyze.py`, featuring residual plots with 95% uncertainty bands, Q-Q plots, and distribution histograms.
-   **Additive Noise Model**: An optional measurement error model ($\sigma^2 = \sigma_1^2 P + \sigma_0^2$) has been implemented to handle low-load noise. This is configurable via `default_config.py`.
